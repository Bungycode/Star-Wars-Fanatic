## Project Process

The project technologies listed below were used to create a Front End web application integrated with a third party API called SWAPI that is tailored to the needs of the user.

The associated technologies include, but are not limited to:

- HTML & CSS to create a beautifully designed web application.

- Javascript utilized to display dynamic HTML content.

- SWAPI API to fetch Star Wars data for the user.

- GitHub to deploy this application Live (Listed below).
  
 Beyond using the aforementioned technologies, I took careful consideration to build a technology that meets the needs of the user. Concretely, this application serves the need for Star Wars fanatics to have a place where they can look up the different Star Wars movies and characters any time they want. More Star Wars features to come!
 
 Upon being presented with the landing page, the user has a navigation bar at the top to navigate to Home (landing page), Star Wars Trivia (will route to the middle of the landing page), and Contact (to email me to have your own unique website created!).

After clicking on "Star Wars Characters" or "Star Wars Movies", the user is presented with a trivia page that lists all the characters or movies. A user can then click on the different characters or movies to get routed to a page that lists the different details about that character or movie.
